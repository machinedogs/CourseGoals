# App Description
The CourseGoals app lets you create and view simple goals and delete them as you complete them.

## Motivation
This is a starter project that highlights the basic of making a React Native App.

### Build Requirments
Follow directions at: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

Use the expo cli quickstart tab. You can follow the necessary steps in the react-native cli tab as well, but this won't be needed for this project.

### React-Native Build Tool Comparison
This project is built under the expo cli (as opposed to the react-native cli).
##### Expo CLI
* Creates Projects Faster
* Doesn't create ios/android project folders (initially)
* Can be exported to a regular react-native project and build ios/android folders by running `expo eject`
* Allows you to test on your own device easily

##### React-Native CLI
* Creates the ios/android project folders initially 
* Lets you write ios/android specific code in their native languages from the start

## Running the Expo Project
1. Clone Repo
2. Run `npm start` in project directory
3. You have many options of running the app now
4. enter `i` or `a` into the terminal to run the app on an ios or android simulator respectively 
5. You will be redirected to a page in your browser called the Metro Bundler which gives you options of running the app on simulators or on your own device
6. To run on your own device, install the expo app onto your phone and scan the qr code
